## ▶️ How to Run Locally

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Set up MySQL

Create database using database/create_tables.sql

Load data using database/load_to_mysql.py

3. Train the model

Run the notebook:
```
notebooks/analysis_and_model.ipynb
```
This will generate model files locally.

4. Run Streamlit app
```
streamlit run app.py
```
